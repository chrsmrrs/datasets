#### Citing this Website
We encourage you to refer to our website at https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/home/ if you have used the data sets for your publication. Please use the following BibTeX citation:

```
@misc{KKMMN2016,
  title  = {Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels},
  author = {Kristian Kersting and Nils M. Kriege and Christopher Morris and Petra Mutzel and Marion Neumann},
  year   = {2016},
  url    = {http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de}
}
```

If your bibliography style does not support the url field, you may use this alternative:

```
@misc{KKMMN2016,
  title  = {Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels},
  author = {Kristian Kersting and Nils M. Kriege and Christopher Morris and Petra Mutzel and Marion Neumann},
  year   = {2016},
  note   = {\url{http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de}}
}
```

## Citing this Website
Please refer to our website at [graphlearning.io](http://www.graphlearning.io/) if you have used the datasets for your publication. Please use the following BibTeX citation:

```
@misc{KKMMN2016,
  title  = {Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels},
  author = {Kristian Kersting and Nils M. Kriege and Christopher Morris and Petra Mutzel and Marion Neumann},
  year   = {2020},
  url    = {http://www.graphlearning.io/}
}
```

If your bibliography style does not support the url field, you may use this alternative:

```
@misc{KKMMN2016,
  title  = {Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels},
  author = {Kristian Kersting and Nils M. Kriege and Christopher Morris and Petra Mutzel and Marion Neumann},
  year   = {2020},
  note   = {http://www.graphlearning.io/}
}
```

**Please do not forget to cite the original paper when using a specific dataset.**

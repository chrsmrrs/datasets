In the following, we give a short overview on how to use the datasets together with the kernel and GNN baselines and standardized evaluation methods. 
First follow the instruction on [github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset](https://github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset). 

### Kernel baselines and 10-CV using SVMs


### GNNs baselines and 10-CV evaluation

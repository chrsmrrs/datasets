In the following, we give a short overview on how to use the datasets together with the graph kernel and GNN baselines and standardized evaluation methods. 
First follow the instruction on [github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset](https://github.com/chrsmrrs/tudataset) to install the TUDataset Python package. 

Throught this tutorial, we assume that you base directionary is 'tudataset/tud_benchmark/'.

### Kernel baselines and 10-CV using SVMs

We provide the following 

### GNNs baselines and 10-CV evaluation
